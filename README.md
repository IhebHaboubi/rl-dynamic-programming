# RL-dynamic programming 

in this notebook we are going to implement 2 dynamic programming algorithms : policy iteration and value iteration.

Thes algorithms are useful when we have the markov decision process of the environment (model-based algorithms)

The environment used in this notebook is FrozenLake8x8 from openai gym environments
